    "This step is handled using two separate queries and results in two final CSV files with different data. The Galaxy Zoo project only has morphology estimates for 27109 galaxies in the given redshift range, while the total SDSS sample for the same range includes 324048 galaxies. To avoid timeout errors in either sample, two functions were created using the arguments of a chunk size (number of galaxies to select), the objid of the last object in the previous list (0 can be chosen for the initial value), and a general filename to query SDSS before creating a CSV file of the given chunk size number of galaxies. The two functions differ only in their query text. The generated files are named iteratively using the filename argument and the final objid in the generated table. This objid is also returned as a value to be used in a looping function. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second function then loops this function using the final objid until there are no galaxies left. After exhausting the pool of galaxies, this function then combines all the previous CSV files into a single larger one to simplify future function calls.\n",

    "The exact RA, DEC, z, zerr, plate, mjd, and fiberid can all be collected from the FITS file, as well as the spectral data required for analysis.\n",

    "The \"TOP 10\" specifier can be removed to return all objects in the library in the redshift range. It is being kept here for testing the methods before performing the full data analysis.\n",

    "As discussed previously, data quality cuts will be made at $\\sigma(W_0[H\\delta]) \\ge 0.8 \\text{ }\\AA$. The data quality cut intended at $\\sigma(D4000_n) \\ge 0.03$ has proved overly restrictive for this redshift range, so another quality cut will be made based on a signal to noise (S/N) ratio of $\\frac{D4000_n}{\\sigma(D4000_n)}>5$. $D4000_n$ must also be positive in both bands, so negative values will be labelled as invalid. Equivalent widths (EWs) are used for S/N ratios for $W_0[H\\delta]$ and $W_0[O\\text{ }II]$. Detections for these bands are defined as $|EW|/EW_{err} \\ge 2$, otherwise the line will be considered \"Absent.\"\n",

    "As a citizen science project, Galaxy Zoo offers estimates for the morphology of a galaxy in the manner of votes provided by users of different possible shapes. The possible votes for a galaxy are spiral - either clockwise or anticlockwise, elliptical, edge on (disk), merger, and unknown. In the determine_shape function, a galaxy is only counted as being one of the given shapes if the votes for that shape account for twice as many as the next highest voted shape, or S/N > 2. Galaxies that do not pass this S/N threshold (and galaxies that pass this threshold as \"dontknow\") will be returned as \"dontknow\" and will not be used for analysis. This function uses the objid to find the galaxy and is paired with a future function (sort_values) and the sort_galaxy function to fetch the shape and classification at the same time for any galaxy."
